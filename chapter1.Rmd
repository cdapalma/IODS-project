# Chapter 1 - Assignment 1 

*This course will help me getting familiar with R, RStudio and GitHub. I hope I can learn some basics of data science and apply this knowledge on some of the data gathered during my PhD.*

Everything went smoothly with first assignment. Installation of the 3 programs went ok, and everything seems to be running. It is my first time working with GitHub and Rstudio. I have been trough some of the R Markdown syntax, and the language is quite strange for me. I didn't quite understood what the Personal Access Token brings more in terms of connection between RStudio and GitHub, as you already are working with the shared IODS.
